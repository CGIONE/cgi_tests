//  Plot pixel revised, 
//  plot rectangle, 
//  plot solid sprite

//  Main function remains unchanged

//  New features are:

1. Plot pixel as a function.
    - pointer is casted from allocated buffer;
    - check and reject out-of-bounds positions;
    - input color is placed at pitch-calculated adress;

    Done! Test!

    Read pixel (at location) function:
    Reverse process to get u32 color 
    of pixel at location.

2. Plot Rectangle function.
    - from upper-left to lower-right;
    - rect dimensions bounds to buffer-screen dimensions;
    - advance to upper-left position of rectangle;
    - fill buffer line with color;
    - advance by pitch;

    Done! Test!

3. Plot solid sprite.
    - plots "rectangle" of pixel data;
    - bound by buffer-screen dimensions;
    - checks if sprite element is transparent;
    - plot 1-to-1 size pixel sprite;

    Done! Test!
